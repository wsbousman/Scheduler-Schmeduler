# Work Day Scheduler 
 A simple calendar app

 Input boxes for each hour of the day save user input to local storage when the save button is clicked so they are automatically displayed when the 
 page is reloaded/browser is closed/reopened. 
 
 Local storage automatically checked for definition; if undefined, input box content set to "Enter new event here" to guarantee clarity to users. 
 
 Code is overall quite repetitive, which I do not love, but it is certainly simple which should make it robust. 

 For reasons that remain unclear to me, the undefined check and "Enter new event here" placeholders for the first three input boxes function perfectly when loaded locally by my browser, but not when loaded on GitHub Pages. Will make note of this with a tutor and troubleshoot.
